Access Modifiers or Access Specifiers in a class are used to assign the accessibility to the class members, i.e., they set some
 restrictions on the class members so that they canâ€™t be directly accessed by the outside functions.
There are 3 types of access modifiers available in C++: 

1.Public-->seen in classes
2.Private
3.Protected
Note: If we do not specify any access modifiers for the members inside the class, then by default the access modifier for the members will be Private.
In java it is default

Default Copying

Understanding :-> On a number line some houses are given to you ; you have to bring all those houses at a valid point 

Valid point = whose cost <=d . 

Find the total number of valid points. 

[-2,3] d = 10 
-> 6 valid points:-> [-2……….3]

C++ Code:- https://ideone.com/ZutDbv
Java Code:- https://ideone.com/6hEUM7
Py Code:- https://ideone.com/0KT7Gz


TC :- O(N*2*10^9) = Not good. Size:- O(1) as no extra array used apart from input array 

—----------------------------------------------------------------------

-> We always want the total cost to be less. (Then there are higher chances that it will be less <=d and those points will be valid.) 


-> If you have points x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 

And you keep a red stick in b/w of x1 and x2 it is being observed that as you are going towards right the total cost is decreasing 


-> Cost will always be the highest outside of the ranges :- [-10^9—-----x1-1]  and [x5+1……………….10^9] and it will strictly increase outside of the ranges. 

-> Cost inside the range will be lower and the middle point  point will always the lowest cost 

-> If there are odd number of points :- Then cost is minimum around [y2+1……..y4-1] (y1,y2,y3,y4,y5) 


-> If even number of points :- (y1,y2,y3,y4,y5,y6) :- Then cost is minimum around [y3….y4]. 

Mid = (y[3]+y[4])/2
